# gamewebpageut
a webpage for videogames

This is a wepage that uses an API called RAWG that shows a lot of information of different videogames. 

The puropose of the web aplication is to show a lot of different videogames data without any necessity to store any local data in our project.
Also, most HTML elements of the project are created dynamically by JavaScript so that we do not need to write any code in our main HTML files to show information about 
the API.

This project is built with HTML, CSS3, JavaScript. 

The project is also responsive so that we can view all the content and use the web app in all the devices we wish to use.
